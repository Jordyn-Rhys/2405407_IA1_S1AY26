                     My mission is to diligently pursue my studies in computer science, continuously expanding my knowledge 
                    and skills through both academic learning and personal projects. I aim to grow as a proficient developer 
                    who creates meaningful and innovative solutions. At the same time, I am committed to deepening my understanding 
                    of God and living out my Christian faith, integrating spiritual growth with my professional and personal 
                    development. This balanced journey guides my purpose and drives me forward each day.

                <p> 
                   My vision is to become a skilled software engineer, creating impactful applications and solutions either by 
                   running my own app business or developing customized programs for clients. Alongside my technical career, I 
                   aspire to be a respected biblical scholar, combining deep scriptural knowledge with practical wisdom. I envision
                    a future where I successfully balance innovation in technology with meaningful contributions to Christian scholarship 
                    and community.

                    <p>
                        This project is a simple virtual machine implemented in C. It uses an instruction set that includes operations such as push (PSH), 
                        add (ADD), pop (POP), set (SET), and halt (HLT). The program simulates a stack-based execution where instructions manipulate a stack 
                        array, handling values with a stack pointer. The main loop fetches and evaluates instructions until the halt command stops execution. 
                        This virtual machine demonstrates basic principles of instruction execution and stack operations in a minimalistic environment.

                    <p>
                        This project is a hash table implementation in C. It includes functionality to create new hash table items, insert, search, and delete
                        key-value pairs efficiently. The hash table dynamically resizes based on its load to maintain performance, using prime number sizes for 
                        better distribution. It uses double hashing with two prime constants for collision resolution. The implementation leverages helper functions 
                        from a prime number module to handle sizing and resizing. Overall, this project provides a robust data structure for fast key-based lookup 
                        and management.

                <p>
                    This chapter emphasizes the importance of setting clear, specific goals and pursuing them with discipline. Jim Rohn and Chris Widener argue that 
                    goals give life direction and purpose. Without them, we drift. The chapter encourages readers to write down their goals, break them into actionable 
                    steps, and review them regularly. For me, this resonates deeply; I often juggle multiple creative and technical projects, and having written goals 
                    would help me prioritize and stay focused. Aligning this with my life means treating each design challenge or coding milestone as a goal with a deadline, 
                    not just a task.

                <p>
                    Time is described as one of our most valuable resources. The authors stress that successful people don’t necessarily have more time—they just use it 
                    better. This chapter challenges readers to audit how they spend their hours and eliminate distractions. As someone who values detail and iteration in 
                    my work, I sometimes get caught in perfectionism. Applying this pillar means setting boundaries around my creative process—knowing when to refine and 
                    when to ship. It also means carving out time for learning and rest, not just production.

                <h3 class="chapter-title">Chapter 6: Surround Yourself with the Best People</h3>
                <p>
                    Here, the authors explore the power of influence. The people we associate with shape our mindset, habits, and ultimately our outcomes. The chapter 
                    encourages readers to seek mentors, build uplifting relationships, and distance themselves from negativity. This hits home for me—collaboration is 
                    central to my growth, and I’ve seen firsthand how working with thoughtful, driven peers elevates my own standards. Aligning this to my life means being 
                    intentional about who I learn from, who I share ideas with, and who I allow to challenge me constructively.

                <p> 
                    This chapter champions curiosity and continuous education. Rohn and Widener argue that personal development is the foundation of success. Whether through 
                    books, podcasts, or conversations, learning should be a daily habit. For me, this is already a core value—I thrive when I’m experimenting with new layouts, 
                    testing responsive techniques, or exploring visual effects. But this chapter reminds me to go beyond just technical skills and invest in emotional intelligence, 
                    leadership, and communication. Aligning this pillar means treating every project not just as output, but as a learning opportunity.
