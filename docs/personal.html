                        Reading Manga 
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        I really enjoy reading manga, especially series that offer intricate plots, standout characters, and creative world-building. 
                        Currently, my top three favorites are One Piece, JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure, and Hunter x Hunter (HxH). Together, these manga series 
                        fuel my love for storytelling and serve as inspiration for creativity and analysis.<br><br>
                        One Piece captivates me with its epic adventure, deep character development, and a sprawling world full of mysteries, powerful 
                        abilities, and the pursuit of dreams. The series masterfully blends humor, action, and heartfelt moments.<br><br>
                        Together, these manga series fuel my love for storytelling and creativity. Reading manga opens me up to different perspectives, 
                        imaginative worlds, and innovative ideas, inspiring me to think creatively and appreciate diverse ways of seeing life and challenges. 
                        This makes manga not only enjoyable but also a meaningful source of personal growth and inspiration.

                    <p>
                        I enjoy playing a variety of games across different genres, from fast-paced shooters like Call of Duty to strategic city builders like 
                        City Skylines. I also dive into MMORPGs such as Albion Online and immersive story-driven games like Red Dead Redemption 2 and Ghost of 
                        Tsushima. Currently, my favorite game is The Finals, which I find engaging and exciting. Gaming not only provides fun and relaxation but 
                        also challenges me to think strategically and improve my skills across different gameplay styles.

                        Theology  
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        One of the most meaningful hobbies I’ve developed recently is theology. It started as a quiet curiosity—just me reading through scripture 
                        and trying to understand the deeper layers of Christianity. But it quickly evolved into something much more intentional. I now spend hours 
                        researching different denominations, exploring doctrinal differences, and diving into biblical texts with a critical and reflective mindset.<br><br>
                        What fascinates me most is the interplay between faith and reason. I’m drawn to arguments for the existence of God and the truth claims of 
                        Christianity—not just to accept them, but to challenge them, refine them, and understand them from multiple angles. I write papers that push 
                        back against interpretations or teachings I find problematic, not out of rebellion, but out of a desire for clarity and truth. <br><br>
                        This hobby has sharpened my thinking and deepened my convictions. It’s not just academic—it’s personal. I’m learning to ask better questions, 
                        to listen more closely to historical and cultural context, and to articulate my beliefs with both humility and precision.

                        Volleyball
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        I played volleyball for three years, and it was an incredible journey. For two of those years, I played on my junior college team. In my very 
                        first year, we showed a lot of promise by finishing second in the Urban Championship, which was a huge achievement and motivated us even more. 
                        By my last year there, we managed to push ourselves to the limit and came out as champions, which was an amazing way to end that chapter of my career.<br><br>
                        Towards the end of my second year, right after high school, I was honored to make the national team. That was a defining moment for me—a real recognition 
                        of my skills and hard work on the court.<br><br>
                        In my final year of playing, I joined UTech’s volleyball team, and once again, I was fortunate enough to be part of a championship-winning squad. 
                        It was a fantastic way to round out my volleyball career.<br><br>
                        Now, I’m retired from playing, but those years on the court taught me a lot about teamwork, perseverance, and the joy of competition. Volleyball was a 
                        big part of my life, and the experiences I had will always stay with me.

                    <p>
                        I played golf for four years starting at the beginning of high school, and those years really shaped me both mentally and emotionally. My golf coach was a key 
                        figure in my development—he wasn’t just teaching me swings and techniques but also helped me build the right mentality and maturity needed for the game. Golf, 
                        being such a mental game, challenged me in ways I hadn’t expected. I failed many times, but with each setback, I grew stronger and more determined.<br><br>
                        During my time at junior college, I played for two years and also competed for my coach’s club, Sewad Sports. I was proud to make the Jamaica national team in my 
                        second year, which was a huge milestone. Unfortunately, COVID-19 struck, and many competitions, including some I was preparing for, were cancelled. Despite that, 
                        I kept playing in various competitions around the island, winning some prizes and meeting new people who shared my passion for golf.<br><br>
                        The loss of my golf coach in my third year was a huge blow. It deeply affected my motivation and will to continue playing. Eventually, I decided to stop playing a 
                        year later. Even though I stepped away from competitive golf, my love for the game has never faded. I still hold a deep passion for golf and feel ready and willing 
                        to continue playing whenever the time is right.

                                Ecclesiastes 8:7 "Since no one knows the future, who can tell someone what is to come?" This inspires me because it reminds me that no one truly knows what the 
                                future holds. It teaches me to accept that uncertainty is a part of life and that I can't control everything that’s coming my way. Instead of worrying about 
                                what might happen, this verse encourages me to focus on the present moment and make the best of it.

                                "Take your medicine"-Patrick Dawes, my past golf coach. was really inspirational to me because it taught me to face my challenges directly and take responsibility 
                                for my mistakes without getting frustrated. Whenever I had to take an extra shot in golf, that reminder helped me stay calm and accept setbacks as a natural part of 
                                the game and my growth. It pushed me to be resilient and patient, showing me that overcoming obstacles requires persistence and a strong mindset.

                    AI-powered personalized fitness and nutrition plans represent a powerful advancement in health and wellness technology. These AI apps analyze individual user data such as age, 
                    gender, activity levels, health goals, and dietary preferences to create tailored meal plans, workout routines, and lifestyle recommendations. Unlike traditional fitness apps, 
                    AI systems dynamically adapt as the user’s needs or lifestyle change, enabling sustainable health progress and maintenance. <br><br>
                    In my world, as a student engaged in fitness and lifestyle management, such an AI-powered app would be incredibly useful. It could optimize my training and nutrition according to 
                    my evolving fitness levels and academic schedule, maximizing efficiency and reducing guesswork.<br><br>
                    However, ethical concerns arise, particularly around data privacy and security. Given the sensitive nature of personal health data, AI fitness apps must protect user information from 
                    unauthorized access and misuse. Another concern is potential algorithmic bias that may lead to inappropriate fitness or nutrition advice for certain groups, which could harm users 
                    instead of helping them.<br><br>
                    My solution to these concerns includes implementing robust data encryption, transparent user consent processes, and strict access controls to safeguard data. Furthermore, rigorous testing 
                    and continuous monitoring of AI algorithms for fairness and accuracy can reduce biases and ensure inclusive, safe recommendations for diverse users.<br><br>
                    An example of a real-world AI fitness app is Noom. It combines personalized coaching, habit tracking, and nutrition guidance powered by AI to support weight loss and healthy lifestyle changes.
